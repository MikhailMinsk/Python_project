Task:
write a server on a flask that would implement the functionality of the guest book

Detailing:
+ at the '/' address, it should issue an html page with
  jQuery and Bootstrap library installed on it
  
+ On the page there should be a beautiful form with two fields:
  "name" and "message" and the "send" button

+ when you click on "send":
  - an asynchronous request to the address '/ comment' occurs
  - the request is validated that it has both
    required fields and if it is valid,
    then the result is saved to the database
  
+ Notify the user: "everything went well"
  if there are any problems, we return an error to the user
  in the new popup window (see the Bootstrap documentation)
